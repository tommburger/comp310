The script create_files.bash creates a set of files in the current directory
This set of files contains files of various sizes and some subdirectories.
The purpose of this is to have a common set of files that will be created on a
number of different volumes.
The helper program build_a_file.c must be compiled and copied into your home
directory.  This program is used to create large files of exactly a specified size.
